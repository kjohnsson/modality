# modality
Statistical tests for evaluating unimodality, in particular:
- Hartigan's dip test (equivalent to excess mass test).
- Silverman's bandwidth test.
- Calibrated versions of the above.

## Usage
Basic usage of the package is showcased in the test files in the
directory `tests/`. Each test file can be run directly or with mpi,
for example
```
mpirun -n N python test_modality.py
```
where `N` is the number of cores to be used.

## Dependencies
The package has the following dependencies:
- Python 2.7, including packages scipy, numpy, matplotlib, mpi4py, (rpy2), scikit-learn
- OpenMPI

rpy2 is necessary for the uncalibrated version of Hartigan's dip test,
as well as R and the R package diptest (see Installation).

### Ubuntu
Python, OpenMPI and the required Python packages can be installed by:
```
sudo apt-get install python, openmpi  
sudo pip install numpy, matplotlib, mpi4py, rpy2, sklearn
```

### Mac
Python and OpenMPI can be installed using homebrew.
First install homebrew following the instructions at http://brew.sh.
Then install Python and OpenMPI:
```
brew install python, openmpi
```
Then Python packages can be installed using
```
pip install numpy, scipy, matplotlib, mpi4py, rpy2, sklearn
```

## Installation
Download modality-1.0.tar.gz and unpack it. In the terminal, go to
the extracted directory modality-1.0 and write
```
python setup.py install
```
If installation for only one user is wanted, you can add the option
`--user`.

During installation, tablulated p-values for Hartigan's dip test
are obtained from the R package 'diptest'. If the package fails to load,
rpy2 tries to install it. Another way to install the 'diptest' R package
is to write "install.packages('diptest')" within R.

## Using MPI
When using parallel execution with MPI, it is recommended to add the
following code to your script, so that the process is aborted if only
one thread fails.

```
from mpi4py import MPI
import traceback
import sys

if MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_size() > 1:
    # Ensure that all threads are terminated if one fails

    def mpiexceptabort(type, value, tb):
        traceback.print_exception(type, value, tb)
        MPI.COMM_WORLD.Abort(1)

    sys.excepthook = mpiexceptabort
```
